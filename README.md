# Helium for ARM mbed #

This code repository exposes an [ARM mbed](https://developer.mbed.org/)
library for
the [Helium Atom](https://www.helium.com/products/atom-xbee-module)
module. The Helium Atom makes it easy to securely connect IoT devices
and applications to back-end IoT services.


## Getting Started ##

See
a
[getting started guide](https://www.helium.com/dev/hardware-libraries/mbed) on
the Helium site.


## Supported Boards ##

The Helium mbed client should work with any mbed board with an
available serial port.

## Example Setup ##

The example sketches can be found in
the [mbed Helium team](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Helium/).

## Getting Help ##

If you have any questions or ideas about how to use this code - or any
part of Helium - head over to
the [Helium Community Slack](http://chat.helium.com/). We're standing
